## 🖋️ Workshop Part 1 — LaTeX Basics

We’ll start from scratch and cover the essentials step by step:

* **Document structure**: `preamble`, `\documentclass`

* **Structured writing**: `section`, `subsection`, and generating a table of contents
* **Lists**: `itemize`, `enumerate`, and `description`
* **Figures & tables**: including images with `graphicx`, using `figure` and `table` floats, adding `caption`, `label`, and cross-references
* **Cross-references & footnotes**: `\ref`, `\pageref`, `\footnote`
* **Customization & beauty**: useful packages, `\newcommand`, page margins, headers, and footers

👉 Every step includes **live exercises** and **common pitfalls**. You’ll finish with a clean, professional **template and checklist** ready for reports, manuals, or any academic document.
